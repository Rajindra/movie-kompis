# MOCK UI

This is a series of scripts to mock the implemenation of the movie recommendation system.

It consists of the following:
- Frontend (index.html)
- Backend (backend.py) 
- Recommendation Engine (recommender.py)

The project can be started using docker compose. For more information about Docker and Compose, please check their respective documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

TODO:
In the file `recommender.py` there is a function called `generate_recommendations`. This is the function that would need to be replaced by the recommendation engine.
